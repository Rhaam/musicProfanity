# Dataset Creation

Here, I include the code and files I used to create the dataset, as well as the final dataset.

## 1. Code Notebook

**File:** [CollectingLyrics.ipynb](https://github.com/Rhaam/musicProfanity/blob/main/building_the_dataset/CollectingLyrics.ipynb)

The notebook contains the code to collect lyrics. Note that if the website the lyrics are collected from changes, this code may no longer work the same way.

## 2. Source File

**File:** [Billboard_Hot100_Songs_spotify_1946-2022.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tushar5harma/billboard-hot-100-songs-spotify-data-1946-2022)

Kaggle link: [Billboard_Hot100_Songs_spotify_1946-2022.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tushar5harma/billboard-hot-100-songs-spotify-data-1946-2022)
This file is sourced from Kaggle and contains Billboard Hot 100 songs for each year from 1946 to 2022. The data is scraped from Wikipedia.

## 3. Final Dataset

**File:** [billboard_top_100_1946_2022_lyrics.csv](https://github.com/Rhaam/musicProfanity/blob/main/building_the_dataset/billboard_top_100_1946_2022_lyrics.csv)

This CSV file is the final dataset we created, which includes lyrics for Billboard Top 100 songs for each year from 1946 to 2022.
