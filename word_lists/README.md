Finding word lists turned out to be one of the more difficult parts of the project.

I started out looking for a list of profane words which was not so easy to find, finally I found a list of words but it also contained words that may only be offensive in 
certain contexts (INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF ORIGINAL LIST).  To narrow down the list of words I would use I found the intersection of the lyrics with the list of words and only kepts word from the profane word that appeard in the lurics this left me with around 400 words... still too many so I manuallt went through and tried removing words based on the standards of what is allowed to be said on the radio (insert standards). 

While looking at the word list I saw some 'religious' words and thought this also could be interesting to look at so I started looking for a list of religious words which was also not east to find, I asked chat gpt to make a list for me, note I tried this with the profane words also but chat gpt refused to give me an answer and told me i may be violating the terms of service.
